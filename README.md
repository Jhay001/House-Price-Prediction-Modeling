Objective: 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using multiple linear regression to estimate housing prices based on various features and attributes of the properties.

Importance: 
Predicting housing prices is a crucial task in the real estate industry as it helps buyers, sellers, and real estate agents make informed decisions. By leveraging data science techniques such as multiple linear regression, we can identify the key factors influencing housing prices and provide valuable insights for pricing strategies, investment decisions, and market trends.

Scope: 
In this project, we will focus on utilizing a dataset that includes features like number of bedrooms, square footage, location, amenities, and other relevant factors that can influence housing prices.

Background:
Multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (housing prices) and multiple independent variables (housing features). By fitting a regression model to the data, we can estimate the coefficients of each feature and understand how they contribute to the overall variability in housing prices.
